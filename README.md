# Node.js Project Template

This is a base Node.js project template, which anyone can use as it has been prepared, by keeping some of the most important code principles and project management recommendations in mind. 
## Project Structure

```plaintext
src/
  ├── config/
  ├── routes/
  ├── middlewares/
  ├── controllers/
  ├── repositories/
  ├── services/
  └── utils/
```

### src

Inside the `src` folder, all the actual source code related to the project resides. This will not include any kind of tests. (You might want to make a separate `tests` folder.)

### config

In this folder, anything and everything regarding any configurations or setup of a library or module will be done. For example:
- **dotenv**: Setting up `dotenv` so that we can use environment variables anywhere in a cleaner fashion. This is done in `server-config.js`.
- **Logging Library**: Configuration for setting up a logging library to prepare meaningful logs should also be done here.

### routes

In the `routes` folder, we register a route and the corresponding middleware and controllers to it.

### middlewares

Middlewares intercept the incoming requests, where we can write our validators, authenticators, etc.

### controllers

Controllers are like the last middleware, as after them, you call your business layer to execute the business logic. In controllers, we:
- Receive incoming requests and data.
- Pass it to the business layer.
- Structure the API response and send the output once the business layer returns.

### repositories

This folder contains all the logic used to interact with the database by writing queries. All raw queries or ORM queries will go here.

### services

The `services` folder contains the business logic and interacts with repositories to retrieve data from the database.

### utils

The `utils` folder contains helper methods, error classes, etc.

## Setup the Project

1. **Download this template** from GitHub and open it in your favorite text editor.

2. **Install dependencies** by navigating to the project folder and running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=<port number of your choice>
    ```

    Example:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=3000
    ```

4. **Initialize Sequelize** by navigating to the `src` folder and executing the following command:

    ```bash
    npx sequelize init
    ```

    By executing the above command, you will get `migrations` and `seeders` folders along with a `config.json` inside the `config` folder.

5. **Database Configuration**:
    - If you're setting up your **development environment**, then write the username of your DB, the password of your DB, and in `dialect`, mention whatever DB you are using (e.g., `mysql`, `mariadb`, etc.).
    - If you're setting up a **test or production environment**, make sure you also replace the host with the hosted DB URL.

6. **Run the Server**:

    To start the server, execute:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
